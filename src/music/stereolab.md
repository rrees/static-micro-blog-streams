# Stereolab

## 6th December, Royal Festival Hall

It is kind of wild that a couple of years ago it was possible to see Tim Gane and Laetita Sadier in their solo intercarnations in pub rooms with a capacity of 50 to 100 people and now I'm up in the gods at the Festival Hall.

The last time I saw them in Shepherd's Bush it felt like the reunion was more or less a money thing with a very low energy feel.

Now one album on it is very different and not only is the music tight but the mood seems light-hearted with Sadier's trademark crowd banter evolving through the night until she tells the audience before the encore to rip up their seats and take them home as a souvenir. On returning to the stage she congratulates the audience on their persistence.

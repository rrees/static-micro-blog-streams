# qutebrowser

Written in Python and binding to the Qt library, using the [QtWebEngine](https://wiki.qt.io/QtWebEngine) as the web renderer (based on Chromium).

The browser is immediately capable and plays video and renders most things fine, which is to perhaps be expected given the engine under the hood.

One thing that is distinctive is that there is a Vim-like command shell with matching which is surprisingly intuitive once you get used to it and a lot easier than shortcuts while still being keyboard-driven.

# Vegetable curry

## Preparation

### Cashew cream

Take 20 to 25 cashews and cover them in hot water.

After approximately 10 minutes drain most of the water and blend them together in the mini blender to create a paste.

## Cooking

Put oil in a pan along with half a teaspoon of cumin seeds, a bay leaf and three to four cardamom pods.

## Notes

The clever thing here was putting the whole chilli into the oil at the start of the cooking process.

Adding sweetcorn, while clever, resulted in the whole thing being too sweet.

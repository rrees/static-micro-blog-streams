# Choices

In not choosing we retain the option to choose anything. When we make a choice we limit ourselves and grieve for the choices we could have made.

If we rebuke ourselves for not choosing we can end up in a cycle of hesitation and recrimination. To choose is as burdensome as to not choose. We need to forgive ourselves whether we choose or not.

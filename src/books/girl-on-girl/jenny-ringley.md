# Jenny Ringley

Jenny Ringley broadcast her student room via an early webcam, dubbed "Jennicam".

At one point she had a relationship with an engaged man that was captured on the camera and was on the receiving end of a moral backlash from her audience. She felt she had to continue the relationship with this man after he broke off his engagement despite not really wanting it.

As ever men are held less accountable for their behaviour and it is interesting that perhaps Ringley saw it as a valid defence if the relationship was about love and stronger attraction rather than being an ill-considered fling.

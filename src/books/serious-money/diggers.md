# Diggers

The mini diggers that are used to excavate basements in London cost around Â£5000. The cost of hiring a crane to extract them from the excavation is more than their value so when they are done they a buried in the foundations of the build.

It is shocking to think about the kind of abundance we have for certain people that we can afford to just discard this kind of machinery.

I also wonder about what meaning hypothetical archaeologists would ascribe to these buried machines if they were to find them. Would it be clear that it was purely a cost-saving in projects costing almost incomprehensible amounts for most members of society or would it be assumed that there was some sacred or mystical reason for the embedding of the machines in the foundations?

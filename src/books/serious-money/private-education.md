# Education

This is not specifically about private versus public education in the UK, it is about a kind of class indoctrination and embedding privilege generationally.

> ... privilege means learning to be at home, how to be at ease, knowing how to carry oneself in any number of situations.

The education system is designed to make the participant feel as if they deserve the benefits not of education but their parent's class and associated wealth and privileges.

> Eton prepares its pupils to *make their way in a competitive world*

> ... it is not who pupils are, but what they do

Competition is the gauze that suggests meritocracy.
